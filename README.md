# DiscordBotty
A Miscellaneous Discord Bot designed and creaded by me, Drew Spelman, for simple, easy, and useful functions commonly used for group situations as well as exploring my personal interest of RuneScape. My initial purpose in making this was to learn Javascript (specifically Node.js), brush up on my programming skills, and learn new tips and tricks for a larger projects. I plan to continue making this bot more extravagant during my free time, but currently there is no set schedule. This is continually a work-in-progress type application, and therefore please note that there may be errors I have yet to see and find.

**NOTE**: Anyone may use this the files associated with this discord bot in any way they please.

TO INSTALL: 
- FIRST: Download the above files.
- SECOND: If you don't have one, create a discord account + server. OR Be a server admin that is allowed to add bots.
- THIRD: Edit auth.json file to include the key for the bot you create. If you need to create one, visit your account on Discord's website.
- FOURTH: Download the necessary API's: Discord.io, Winston, Runescape-API, and CLI-table2. *Will expand this as needed.*
- FIFTH: To run the bot, find where these files are located in your computer and type the following command:
```node bot3.js```


*Some things to notice:*
- Users may be interested in the fact that a log is continually updated as users request the bot via commands
- RuneScape and Old School RuneScape accounts are seperated, but can both be tied to a single user.
- Usernames are saved and can be updated at any time.
- Roulette game is localized and does not interfere with other instances of the game.
- Useful uptime feature
